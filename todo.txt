# Todo list for NVDA Addon Team #

in the following:
bitNVDA=http://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam

# outstanding #

* Pending review: controlUsageAssistant, teamtalk, ventrilo, apolo2, windows7Magnifier, Focus Highlight
* Idealy documentation should only be written once, and accessed both 
from the web and from nvda itself.
Good discussion with nolia on addon list, some code already in addon template, code on 2694, needs final review and the  code belongs in core nvda.
* Joseph, finnish nvda core translator comments, Mesar to review.

# To Discuss #

# Historical/notes #

* Derek, review translatable strings for place markers.
* The add-ons mailing list has been created, and the list has been widely publisized.
* When we know the system works well for one or two addons, we should write an announcement/invitation for people to submit addons.
* Mesar, write scripts to integrate with translator workflow and the community addon website.
** When an addon is added to bitNVDA/addon-files it will automatically be available for download.
** Addon pot files are merged into po files every mon/thu, just like main nvda.po.
** po files from translators are merged back into addons at the middle and end of each month, like what we do with nvda.
** We need to check nvda/srt/website/addon/addon.mdwn and nvda/addons/{addonName}/readme.mdwn are the same by hand, potentially list new languages that have been added.

* beqa, mesar, review resource monitor and unicode-braille-input addons.
