# outstanding #

* When we know the system works well for one or two addons, we should write an announcement/invitation for people to submit addons.
* beqa, review teamtalk, ventrilo and  apolo2.
* Joseph, check translator comments.


# To Discuss #

* Idealy documentation should only be written once, and accessed both 
from the web and from nvda itself.
@Rui what needs to be done on my side?
* JL: Mesar suggests coming up with guidelines for new add-on contributors.


# Historical/notes #

* Mesar, write scripts to integrate with translator workflow and the community addon website.
** When an addon is added to bitNVDA/addon-files it will automatically be available for download.
** Addon pot files are merged into po files every mon/thu, just like main nvda.po.
** po files from translators are merged back into addons at the middle and end of each month, like what we do with nvda.
** We need to check nvda/srt/website/addon/addon.mdwn and nvda/addons/{addonName}/readme.mdwn are the same by hand, potentially list new languages that have been added.

* beqa, mesar, review resource monitor and unicode-braille-input addons.
