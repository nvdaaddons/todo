# To Discuss #

# Historical/notes #

* T2694: remove documentation generation routine from SCons once NVDA 2014.3 is released.
* Create an add-on development guide, which will serve as an extension of NvDA core Development Guide but designed for writing add-ons.
* Script category: use NVDA core categories if an add-on enhances the functionality of NVDA such as adding shortcuts to preferences dialogs; use add-on name if the add-on adds misc features such as system information.
* document where the prefered path of addon config files should be saved in guidelines document.
The new path allows for addons to be used while running temp copy of nvda or something like that.
* Let commit emails go to a commit list, rather than to the nvda-addons discussion mailing list.
* Idealy documentation should only be written once, and accessed both 
from the web and from nvda itself.
Done thanks to addon template.
* Noelia, see Jamies last comment on #2694.
* Derek, review translatable strings for place markers.
* The add-ons mailing list has been created, and the list has been widely publisized.
* When we know the system works well for one or two addons, we should write an announcement/invitation for people to submit addons.
* Mesar, write scripts to integrate with translator workflow and the community addon website.
** When an addon is added to bitNVDA/addon-files it will automatically be available for download.
** Addon pot files are merged into po files every mon/thu, just like main nvda.po.
** po files from translators are merged back into addons at the middle and end of each month, like what we do with nvda.
** We need to check nvda/srt/website/addon/addon.mdwn and nvda/addons/{addonName}/readme.mdwn are the same by hand, potentially list new languages that have been added.

* beqa, mesar, review resource monitor and unicode-braille-input addons.
