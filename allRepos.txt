# Getting all nvda addon team repositories #

If you are a community team reviewer, or want to learn how addons are written, you probably want to bulk clone or manage the available repositories.

At the moment, there are two ways of doing this, documented below.

## Using mr, myRepositories ##


### Get and install Perl ###

If you are using cygwin, you probably have perl already installed, if you are using git bash, you can download and install perl here[1].
After running the windows executable you probably need to add the pearl binaries directory to your system path variable.

To check that perl is correctly working from the terminal, you can type:

    perl --version

If everything went according to plan then you should see the perl version number.

### Getting the mr script ###

In the terminal download the mr perl script, and move it to a directory in the path.

    wget https://raw.github.com/mhameed/myrepos/master/mr
    mv mr /usr/bin/

To check that mr is working, now type:

    mr --version

Note: this version is needed, because it contains a fix to a bug in the official version.

@mhameed, update url when patch has been accepted.

 
### Setting up the directory structure ###

Now create a directory on one of your partitions, which is easely reachable, and does not have a space in its path.
something like:

    c:\nvdaSources\

Navigate to the directory using the cygwin or git bash terminal, and clone the addon team configuration repo.

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/nvda-mrconfig .

Now we need to tell mr to trust this downloaded config and run it.

    echo `pwd`/.mrconfig >>~/.mrtrust
    echo "[`pwd`]" >>~/.mrconfig
    echo "chain = true" >>~/.mrconfig

## Using bash scripts ##
