# Add-on guidelines #

The following is a set of guidelines that current and potential add-on authors should use when writing add-ons:

## General ##

1. Use the addonTemplate from http://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/addonTemplate
2. Addon name should not contain "nvda", "plugin", "appmodule", 
"globalPlugin" as part of its name, the user should not have to worry 
about implementational issues.
3. Addon name should be of the form "name", or "firstSecond" or 
"first_second"
examples: "word", "dropbox", "extendedWinamp", "resourceMonitor" or 
"resource_monitor".
Dashes in names are currently not supported by the automated system.

## Versioning ##
1. Use major dot minor revision, example: 1.0, 1.1 etc.
2. When new functionality is added, update major revision, i.e. 2.0, 
3.0.
3. When making a release that has only translation updates, update the 
minor revision, 3.1, 3.2 etc, add the new languages to the readme.mdown.
4. git tag the release.
5. After making a release, update the version to indicate that its under development for the next version, i.e. 3.1-dev.
6. Releases should be made no closer than 2 weeks apart, to allow translators to do their work, unless fixing a chritical/showstopper bug.
7. Announce the availibility of the new version on various NVDA mailing lists (e.g. NVDA add-ons list).

## Coding Style ##

1. Indent with either 4 spaces or 1 tab.
2. All messages presented to the user should be translatable, if we are 
the creator of the message.
3. Messages containing multiple '%s' or %'d' or are of the form
"%(name)s .. %(name2)s" should be rewritten to _("{name1} .. {name2}").format(name1=v1, name2=v2)
4. Translatable messages should have a translator comment to explain 
where/when the message is presented, so that the translator can test the 
message easily when s/he installs the addon.
5. When working on a new or modifying a major feature, create/use branches other than master branch, as it helps merging and code review (via pull request) process and to find bugs easily.

## Documentation and key bindings ##

1. If you are adding new keyboard commands as part of your add-on, be sure to consult NVDA Command Quick Reference and other community supported add-on commands before assigning a new command.
2. Please provide a readme file listing changes between versions, shortcut keys (if any) and usage notes and other information, see one of the other git repos for examples.
