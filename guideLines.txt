# Addon guide line#

## General ##

1. Use the addonTemplate from http://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/addon-template
2. Addon name should not contain "nvda", "plugin", "appmodule", 
"globalPlugin" as part of its name, the user should not have to worry 
about implementational issues.
3. Addon name should be of the form "name", or "firstSecond" or 
"first_second"
examples: "word", "dropbox", "extendedWinamp", "resourceMonitor" or 
"resource_monitor".
Dashes in names are currently not supported by the automated system.

## Versioning ##
1. Use major dot minor revision, example: 1.0, 1.1 etc.
2. when new functionality is added, update major revision, i.e. 2.0, 
3.0.
3. When making a release that has only translation updates, update the 
minor revision, 3.1, 3.2 etc, add the new languages to the readme.mdown.
4. git tag the release.
5. After making a release update the revision to indicate that its under 
development for the next version, i.e. 3.1-dev.

## Coding Style ##

1.. Indent with either 4 spaces or 1 tab.
2. All messages presented to the user should be translatable, if we are 
the creator of the message.
3. messages containing multiple '%s' or %'d' or are of the form
"%(name)s .. %(name2)s" should be rewritten to _("{name1} .. {name2}").format(name1=v1, name2=v2)
4. Translatable messages should have a translator comment to explain 
where/when the message is presented, so that the translator can test the 
message easily when s/he installs the addon.
